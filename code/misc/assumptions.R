# Assumptions ------------------------------------------------------------------
# - We assume density independent transmission rates
# - We assume that there is no transmission of the vaccine, and that there are no other lower-virulent strains of the virus circulating
# - We assume that probability of death is the same between strain 1 and strain 2 after first infection
# - Vaccination completely protects chickens from mortality, and is only conducted in farms
# - We assume no super-infection in the system
# - We assume when vaccinated infectious chickens transmit, they have the same transmission rate as non-vaccinated infectious chickens
# - Beta is, roughly, the number of chickens a single infectious chicken infects in a month
